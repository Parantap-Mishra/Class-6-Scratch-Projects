# My First Scratch Projects — The Beginning of My Coding Journey 🧒💻

This repository is a collection of my **very first coding projects** made using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) when I was in **Class 6** (around 11 years old). These simple games and animations may not look like much today, but they represent the exact moment where my journey into **coding, programming, and problem-solving** truly began.

At that time, I had just been introduced to the world of programming — no variables, no functions, no syntax errors — just the joy of **drag-and-drop blocks** and the ability to bring imagination to life. These projects were my first taste of building something of my own with code.

## 🌟 Featured Projects

Here are some Scratch projects I made back then:

1. 🎮 [**Go Guardian!**](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/619144665)  
   A simple but exciting game where the player flies a fighter plane dodging and destroying enemy flights.

2. 🧊 [**Shooting Game**](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/619128785)  
   A simple 2D shooting game with scoring system

3. 🧍 [**Short Film**](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1196661102)  
   A short film on Abby's adventure

## 💡 Why This Repo?

I wanted to include these projects on my GitHub not because they are technically complex — they aren't — but because they **mark the beginning** of everything I’ve built since. 

Every advanced project, every research paper, and every internship traces back to this spark. Looking back, these simple Scratch games were what ignited my curiosity and led me down the path of coding, problem-solving, and creative building.
